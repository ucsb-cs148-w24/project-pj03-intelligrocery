# Intelligrocery

Intelligrocery is a smart mobile application that consolidates all of your pantry items, grocery lists, and recipe management into one place. Using Intelligrocery, you can look up a new recipe or select an old favorite, and instantly see what items you need to add to your grocery list, and which ones you already have in your pantry at home. Intelligrocery uses a recipe API that has thousands of recipes so that every single person is sure to find recipes that fit their needs and tastes. Whenever you add a new recipe, Intelligrocery checks your pantry and your ongoing grocery list to see what other items you need to buy, and by saving your favorite recipes you can get to them quickly and add them to your list in an instant. Users such as Alexa, a 32 year old single mother and lawyer, will love Intelligrocery as it saves them time and money! With her busy schedule, Alexa loves being able to add her favortie recipes on the go, and always knowing what she has at home and in her grocery list so she never forgets an ingredient for a special meal she wants to cook for her family. Ilai, a college student loves Intelligrocery as it helps him save money and time!
