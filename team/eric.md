Hello, my name is Eric Marzouk and I am a 3rd year Computer Science Major at UCSB.

I envision this app to serve as a well-oiled grocery list.

You can search up recipes, and see what ingredients you dont have from those recipes and add it to your grocery list.
Also, when you run out of ingredients in your house, then you would tell the app that you need to go grocery shopping for this item.
