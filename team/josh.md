Hi my name is Josh Son and I am a 4th year computer science major from Seattle, Wa. I am familiar with React and HTML/CSS.

My ideas for the project is to also have a calorie tracker for the specific recipes that our application will suggest. This will be used using the barcode of the food items. There are api's we can use for this.
