## Retro Assessment

### A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
- We used the start, stop, continue method once again. We took 5 minutes to each write down our own points, and then went around 3 times sharing our starts, stops, and continues. Then, we combined and voted for the best ones.
### A brief assessment of how it went.
- It went well. We all were on the same page as a group. This helped us develop clear goals in order to make our next week even more effective.
### What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
- To have an open mind with everyone's ideas.

## Experiment/Change

- Description: By having users test our app, we will be able to see where our shortcomings are, and change our software development to cater to user needs.

- Outcome: We saw that this helped us. We ended up changing the sliding UI since there were complaints about it not being user friendly. This, as a result made our app more user friendly, and nicer to look at.

- Decision: We have decided that we will continue this process of cultivating user feedback in order to constantly improve our app. This decision is based on the belief that having user testing helps us cater to the user experience and therefore makes our app easier to use.
