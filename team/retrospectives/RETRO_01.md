## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
- We used the start, stop, continue method. We took 10 minutes to each write down our own points, and then went around 3 times sharing our starts, stops, and continues. Then we consolidated those into 3 bullet points for each category
* A brief assessment of how it went.
- It went really well. We all got on the same page as a group, and created clear goals in order to make our next week even more effective.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
- I would give the next person leading a retro the advice to just listen and pay attention to the things the team is saying in order to know how to consolidate them and form a clear team vision for the next week
