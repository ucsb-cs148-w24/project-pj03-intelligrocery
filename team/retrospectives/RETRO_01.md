## Retro Assessment

### A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
- We used the start, stop, continue method. We took 10 minutes to each write down our own points, and then went around 3 times sharing our starts, stops, and continues. Then we consolidated those into 3 bullet points for each category
### A brief assessment of how it went.
- It went really well. We all got on the same page as a group, and created clear goals in order to make our next week even more effective.
### What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
- I would give the next person leading a retro the advice to just listen and pay attention to the things the team is saying in order to know how to consolidate them and form a clear team vision for the next week

## Experiment/Change

- Experiment description: As part of last week's emphasis on continuous but organized code development, we decided to each develop on our own branches for each user storey/issue. This was going to mitigate the merge conflicts we had been experiencing, as well as help each person work individually on their tasks while everyone is working concurrently. 
- Each of us made our own branches for the things we were working on, which really helped prevent merge conflicts. This was especially true for people's tasks with many installed dependencies, like Danny/Jos with AWS that we ultimately didn't use. This helped us integrate multiple people's work yet work fast and continuously. 
- We think we'll continue but with the addendum: when checking out to a new branch, pull from main if you don't checkout from main so your branches don't become to behind. But branching really helps.
