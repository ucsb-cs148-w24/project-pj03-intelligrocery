### Stop:
- Stop letting branches sit
- Stop disregarding the Kanban board
- Stop solo missioning and stop not communicating
### Continue:
- Continue having flexible hours
- Continue dividing up work evenly
- Continue working hard and completing our tasks

## Retro Assessment

### A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
- We used the start, stop, continue method once again. We took 5 minutes to each write down our own points, and then went around 3 times sharing our starts, stops, and continues. Then we consolidated those into 3 bullet points for each category. We also had Josh, Nadav, and Eric participate online via text.
### A brief assessment of how it went.
- It went really well. We all got on the same page as a group, and created clear goals in order to make our next week even more effective.
### What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
- I would give the next person leading a retro the advice to really hear everyone out and just facilitate discussion. 

## Experiment/Change

- Description: As part of last week's emphasis on not letting branches sit and creating more pull requests, we decided to set a time limit for a pr to be merged (we decided on 2-day limit after a pr has been created). This will reduce merge conflicts by keeping main up-to date instead of letting prs sit. 
- Outcome: Despite the intention to expedite the merging process and minimize merge conflicts by setting a 2-day limit on pull requests, the outcome was not as expected. We observed an increase in merge conflicts, contrary to our goal of reducing them. This increase can be attributed to the accelerated pace at which pull requests were created and the pressure to merge them quickly, leading to insufficient review and integration testing time. This rush resulted in more frequent integration issues, as not all code changes were thoroughly vetted for compatibility with the main branch. 
- Decision: After evaluating the outcomes and considering the increased merge conflicts and the subsequent delays in the merging process, we have decided to continue with the 2-day limit, with some flexibility, for merging pull requests. This decision is based on the belief that with adjustments and more rigorous adherence to best practices for code review and testing, we can overcome the initial hurdles.
