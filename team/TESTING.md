# Testing

Document the testing library/ies and approach/es you experimented with and the unit test(s) that you implemented in your codebase.

The testing libraries we used was jest. There were a few niche errors that we had to deal with. The most notable one was the specific jest libraries for React Native. When writing unit tests, we started off simple and made sure that the jest tests were working properly by testing that App.js was rendering correctly. Once that unit test returned results that we wanted, we proceeded to test our "Add Ingredient" feature. We used Github Copilot and GPT-4 to help test code. This test case was relatively large and needed a lot of tweaks even while using Github Copilot and GPT-4.
