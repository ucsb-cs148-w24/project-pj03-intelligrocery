# Testing

Document the testing library/ies and approach/es you experiemnted with and the unit test(s) that you implemented in your codebase.

The testing libraries we used was jest. There were a few niche errors that we had to deal with. The most notable one was the specific jest libraries for React Native. When writing unit tests, we started off simple and made sure that the jest tests were working properly with testing that app.js was rendering correctly. Once that unit test returned results that we wanted, we wanted to be able to test our "Add Ingredient" feature. We used Github Copilot and GPT-4 to help test code.
