#Problem Scenario

- A user wants to create a certain dish and know what ingredients they are missing for the 
recipe.
- A user has ingredients at home and wants to know what recipes they can make with what they have. 
- A user often forgets what he wants to buy so having an intelligent grocery list (intelligrocery) would really help him
- A user is gluten free so he wants an app that can understand his dietary restrictions when adding ingredients to his grocery list or recommending recipes to him
- A user might be interested in expanding their cooking skills and experimenting with new culinary ideas
