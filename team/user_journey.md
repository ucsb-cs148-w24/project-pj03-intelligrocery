#User Journey

- As a User, I can input foods, so that I can see what ingredients I already have.
- As a User, I can request a new recipe so that the app adds its items to my grocery list. 
- As a User, I can share my grocery list with another user, so that we can both know what ingredients we are missing. 
- As a User, I can input my dietary information so that the app recommends recipes I can eat
- As a user, I can ask the app what recipe I can make out of my current ingredients
- As a user I can record my history of recipes to track my progress and help the app learn my likes
