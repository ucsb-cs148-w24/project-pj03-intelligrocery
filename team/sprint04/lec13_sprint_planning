#Scribed Discussion
- While planning out our design document, we prioritized the tasks we need to do for our next demo
- We decided the importance of page interactions (adding to pantry from grocery list, adding from recipe page to grocery list), and that this would require changes in app stucture/storing of our grocery/pantry DS
- We wanted to change our styling to be consistent add/swipe/delete/edit in both grocery list and pantry, as well as restrict edits to our number pad and unit drop down menu
- We mentioned the need to completely integrate firebase into new functions
- We split up work for code vs design document creation
