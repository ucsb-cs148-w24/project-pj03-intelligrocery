# Description of me

Hi! My name is Danny Rose and I'm a 3rd-year CS major at UCSB. I am interested in starting companies, so I'm excited to take this class to gain experience in team-based project development and front end development.

# Ideas for the project

Building off of the ideas we discussed in section, these are some of my ideas.
- Allow the user to input their dietary restrictions so when creating recipes or grocery list items, the app/AI backend doesn't include potentially-dangerous items
- Have a GPT backend to be able to communicate with the app so it can suggest you recipes, whether you have general or specific ideas. Then you can have specific buttons to add the recipe items to the grocery list, or continue editing the recipe.
- It may be good to have some sort of history, whether that is prices of what you bought, how much you enjoyed a past recipe. That could help the model recommend better recipes to tailor to your likes and dislikes
