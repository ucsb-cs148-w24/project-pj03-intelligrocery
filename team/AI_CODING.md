# AI Testing

List the AI tool you utilized, the outcomes you produced, and, importantly, reflections on: 
* how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
* what steps you needed to (or couldn’t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use

#### Nadav
* Used github copilot to look up errors rather than online as well as gather information about libraries
* used github copilot to write tests
* I found that using AI to learn about the libraries I was using was an efficient way to learn rather than parse through heavy documentation, and the tests were very efficient and time saving as well as modular so I could change them as I liked to test different functionalities which helped refine the app.
* Copilot was very useful and I could see it having a big impact on the project going forward

#### Eric
* Used chatGPT to brainstorm ideas on how to create services and controllers for API
* Used Bing AI image generator to generate ideas for logo within app.

#### Audrey
* Used Codeium to help generate code for making pantry items editable
* I thought that Codeium was useful and convenient to use, especially since it's free and automatically looks at the rest of the codebase for context. 
* Most of the time, the AI output was not immediately correct and useable, and I had to make alterations to it in order to make everything work. However, it was a useful starting point, and I think it would potentially be a helpful tool going forward.

#### Michael
* Used GBT4 to research/learn about parent child components, and how to transfer props defined in the parent component to child components.
* Used github copilot to write unit tests
* Learning about parent child components through GBT4 was nice and saved me time. GBT4 does have its limitations, so I use it as a supplement. When I under-feed info, GBT's answers arent detailed enough, so I have to provide more info to it.
* I really enjoyed using github copilot, and it has the same limitations as mentioned above.
#### Anderson
* Used chatGPT to learn how to save user inputted values in states on click of a button.
* I found that using AI to learn new applications of code is much more efficient than parsing through heavy documentation. However, AI provides a very surface level understanding. To be able to understand concepts clearly, I still needed to do some learning on my own.
* To make sure the code was correct, I had to make some changes to the AI output to make it fit the context of my code.

#### Danny
* I used DALLE-2 and pixlr.com for possible app art. For example, I created a wooden login page to simulate a cutting board which renders at login time. In addition, I made art for the app art.
* I also asked Chat-GPT for how to code icons for app tabs, database functions, component interactions.

#### Josh
* Used GitHub Copilot to help write testing for our recipes page. GitHub Copilot also helped me generate code to make sure that the quantity input field worked with the testing code written.
* Github Copilot was very useful in creating test cases, however, my strategy actually was writing the test code with assistance using GitHub Copilot then seeing if GPT-4 could see any errors.
* To insure the output was correct, I ran the test code multiple times and realized syntatically errors throughout the terminal. I started with simple rendering tests and seeing if Copilot could do that. I discovered that Copilot performed okay, but with GPT-4, it was able to write competent.
