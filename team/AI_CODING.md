# AI Testing

List the AI tool you utilized, the outcomes you produced, and, importantly, reflections on: 
* how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
* what steps you needed to (or couldn’t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use

#### Nadav
* Used github copilot to look up errors rather than online as well as gather information about libraries
* used github copilot to write tests
* I found that using AI to learn about the libraries I was using was an efficient way to learn rather than parse through heavy documentation, and the tests were very efficient and time saving as well as modular so I could change them as I liked to test different functionalities which helped refine the app.
* Copilot was very useful and I could see it having a big impact on the project going forward


#### Eric
* Used chatGPT to brainstorm ideas on how to create services and controllers for API
* Used Bing AI image generator to generate ideas for logo within app.
