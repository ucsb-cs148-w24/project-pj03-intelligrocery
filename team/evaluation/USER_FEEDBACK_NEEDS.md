## USER FEEDBACK NEEDS

- User satisfcation and feedback on how our app uses recipes, do they additional features like designing their own recipes, having recipes suggetsed from your pantry ingredients, saving recipes, a message if a recipe is ready to cook, etc.
- If the user wants any specific settings for the app when they'd use it, like dietary restrictions, the time the pantry item has been in the pantry for, reminders to buy things
- User satisfaction and feedback on how ingredients are stored (name, quantity, units) and edited (click and edit text), should anything change?
- What design elements are inconsistent or jarring which makes the user experience not ideal for using the app
