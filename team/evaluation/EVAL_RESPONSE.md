## Evaluating our team demo

  1.  Feedback based on your own USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
  - They liked how our ingredients were stored
  - Thought prompt to add new ingredients was small, make pop up bigger
  - Recipes: They thought saving favorite recipes would be ideal, and splitting by recipes in grocery list could be cool
  - They thought an app description on login screen would make UI better
  - Convert edit function to pop up (we probably won't implement this)
  2.  A summary of the features of the product as the other team understood them, and what they liked or thought could be
      improved about each
  - They underestood that our app had three main features: a grocery list, pantry list, and looking for online recipes so you can add ingredients to your grocery list. They thought most improvements was in UI or certain recipe features liked saved favorite recipes.
  3.  How intuitive it was to use the project (comments about the UI/UX design and robustness of the app)
  - They thought UI for adding/deleting/editing list items was user-friendly
  - Potentially make addIngredient overlay bigger so it's easier on the eyes
  - Making the sign in screen more understandable with more text description
  - Recipes look good and easy to use with search bar/add ingredients
  4.  A summary of how the other team was able to follow the deployment instructions and how helpful / organized the other team found your team's repo (README.md, Kanban Board, maybe code).
  - Deployment was very easy for the other team since they also used an Expo app. So they didn't need to install any additional software, and they had the Expo app preinstalled. All they had to do was scan our QR code, and our instructions specified to do this via Camera for iOS or via the app for Android.
  - They didn't mention much about github/kanban but they said the overall organization/flow of our folders and issues made sense
  5.  The other team's final closing thoughts: something they liked, the most impactful opportunity for improvement,
      and one more thing they thought was good.
  - They liked our app overall, thinking it was cool to integrate a recipe UI for suggested recipes with maintained user lists. They thought it was cool that our app was authenticated and the user data seamlessly stored with our database so any reloads of the app would reload our lists in the intuitive UI format that existed before closing the app.
